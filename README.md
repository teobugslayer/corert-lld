# corert-lld
Proved a minimal set of compile-time dependences to enable projects to be build with CoreRT.
The end goal is to avoid installation of Windows 10 SDK and MS Visual C++ toolset.

Currently it provides the linker from LLVM 10.0 and minimal set of import libraries linked by default by CoreRT.
